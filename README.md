# Aztta

Aztta is a notetaking, journaling, and mindmapping application designed around the mechanic of _tethering_.

- Aztta borrows the _node_ convention from other mindmapping applications. Nodes are interactive representations which are both textual and spatial.
- Tethering is a term for linking two nodes together to assign meaning.
- Once nodes and links are created, the user manipulates with embodied and immersive interaction.
- Nodes and links are central elements of study in graph theory; both can also be conceptualized as objects under an object-oriented programming paradigm. Taken together, these frames afford bottom-up insight generation, such as through assigning weights to edges or assembling all nodes of a particular assigned property in a location.

Things you can do to nodes:
- Set position

Things you can do to links:
- Set weight

Things you can do to objects:
- Show or hide
- - Assign properties

Functions are machines that can 

Things you can do with functions:
- Show or hide nodes and links based on an assigned property.
- Set position of nodes based on an assigned property


Automata theory also opens the door for functions that, once initialized, can operate without user intervention.


## Naming
 
I was looking up the Amizagh language for inspiration for the naming of this application. Also known by their exonym "Berber", the Amizagh people are an ethnic group in North Africa, particularly well-known for their horseriding practices. 

This remains to be verified, but according to the Tafsut Dictionary mobile app, the term _Aztta_ is associated with the following meanings: net, loom, weaving, fate, network, networked communications, organizational chart, information network, trophic network / food web, and honeycomb. 

Seems like the perfect name for a program designed around tethering.
